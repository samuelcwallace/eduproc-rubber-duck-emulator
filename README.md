# eduproc-rubber-duck-emulator

The rubber duck is a humble bathtub companion whose debugging prowess has long been noted.

They achieve allowing the errant programmer to explain in plain English the troubling code, and the paradoxes inherent.

This software has very similar goals, in that it does not detect any gliches by itself, but shows what the programmer might have been blinded to by syntax and assumptions.

This will attempt a line-by-line translation from either a plain-English based pseudocode into valid java, and back again. It aims to be bijective.

This software is currently being deployed on Michigan Technological University's WebTA system. I am currently not actively developing it.

For any questions on this software, contact swallace@mtu.edu or samcw@umich.edu.

This can be modified and used for individual, non commercial use. If you would like to use this software for institutional use, or distribute a modification please contact ureel@mtu.edu.
